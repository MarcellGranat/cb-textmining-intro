## The Influence of Stories

George Akerlof and Robert Shiller [-@akerlof2010animal] highlighted in their classic book "*Animal Spirits*" that one of the most important factors driving markets are the **stories of the given "era"**. The value of the stock market and our assets are not only explained by our stories, but the **stories are shaping the markets**.

## The Influence of Stories

::: r-fit-text
> "The **Internet** was indeed an important new technology. This new technology was especially salient because of its **presence in our daily lives**. All of us use the Internet. It is on our desktops, at our fingertips. The stories ofyoung people making fortunes were a **contemporary reenactment of the nineteenth-century Gold Rush**. The **steady progress of technology**, which has dominated economic growth for centuries-consisting of millions of incremental advances in **areas like materials science, chemistry, mechanical engineering, and agricultural science-has never attracted the public's interest**. These stories arc not popular. There are few statistics in People magazine. **But with the Internet, the economy literally got carried away with the story.**" --- @akerlof2010animal

> "I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind; it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely in your thoughts advanced to the stage of science, whatever the matter may be." -- Baron William Thomson Kelvin

# Tools you need to know for text mining🧑‍💻

## Sentiment Analysis 😏

-   Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) in a given piece of text.
-   It is widely used in text mining to understand the overall opinion or sentiment expressed by individuals or groups.
-   The magnitude of the sentiment score can also indicate the intensity of the sentiment.

## Sentiment Analysis 😏

##### An example

::: r-fit-text
```{r}
#| results: asis
example_text <- '"Market sentiment shifted with concerns over rising inflation, causing uncertainty and apprehension among traders. This news triggered a sell-off in certain sectors, with investors adopting a cautious approach. Amid this backdrop, the market exhibited volatility, reflecting the emotional rollercoaster of market participants. Sentiment plays a crucial role in determining market direction, as investors feelings and emotions can sway their investment decisions. Stay tuned for updates on how sentiment continues to impact the stock market."'

##### Identified words with bing sentiment dictionary

::: r-fit-text
```{r}
#| results: asis

r_df <- tidytext::get_sentiments("bing") |> 
  mutate(
    word = str_remove_all(word, "[*]"),
    replacement = case_when(
      sentiment == "positive" ~ str_c("[", word, "]"),
      sentiment == "negative" ~ str_c("[", word, ']{style="color: red;"}')
    )) |> 
  filter(
    map_lgl(word, .progress = .p("filter"),  ~ str_detect(example_text, .))
  ) |> 
  filter(!word %in% c("sin", "taint", "mar", "pan", "ire", "deter", "dire"))

example_text_annotated <- example_text |> 
  str_replace_all(
    set_names(r_df$replacement, r_df$word)

## Sentiment Analysis 😏

## Choice of dictionary

It's essential to choose the right dictionary for accurate sentiment analysis. Consider the coverage, context, and accuracy of the dictionary to ensure reliable results.
:::

::: r-fit-text
Some popular dictionaries (All available in the [`{tidytext}`](https://github.com/juliasilge/tidytext) R package.):

::: nonincremental
-   `AFINN`: A popular English-language dictionary that assigns sentiment scores ranging from -5 to 5.
-   `Bing`: Developed by Microsoft, it classifies words as positive or negative.
-   `NRC`: An extensive emotion lexicon that assigns sentiments based on eight different emotions.

::: callout-caution
## Choice of dictionary

It's essential to choose the right dictionary for accurate sentiment analysis. Consider the coverage, **context**, and accuracy of the dictionary to ensure reliable results.
:::

::: r-fit-text
In certain contexts, the meaning of certain words can vary from the typical one. For instance, conventional dictionaries classify **"increase"** with a **positive** sentiment, but in news related to **COVID-19 infection**, it is probable not appropriate. This is why scholars frequently apply thematic dictionaries to their analytics.
:::

## Method Overview (basic)

::: r-fit-text
1.  Split the text into individual words.
2.  Assign a sentiment score to each word.

-   Each word is assigned a sentiment score based on a **pre-defined sentiment lexicon** or dictionary.
-   The sentiment lexicon contains a **list of words along with their associated sentiment scores**.
-   For example, **positive words 👍** may have a score of +1, **negative words 👎** may have a score of -1, and **neutral words 😐** may have a score of 0.

3.  Calculate the overall sentiment score ($\sum$) for the text.

## Topic modelling

Topic modeling is a technique used in natural language processing and text mining to **automatically discover topics** or themes from a collection of documents. It helps in understanding the main ideas or concepts present in the text data.

::: callout-warning
This is an unsupervised machine learning tool, thus it does not have a target (outcome) ⛳ variable to assess its modeling effectiveness. It is not always clear how many topics we should aim to identify 🤷‍♂️. We want to avoid that our model is overly complicated and messy, but we also don't want important topics to be merged together ⚖️. As a result, there is always some subjective judgment 🧑‍⚖️ and need for fine-tuning (➡️ mostly time-consuming).
:::

## Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

LDA assumes that (1) **each document is a mixture of a small number of topics**, and (2) **each topic is characterized by a distribution of words**. The goal of LDA is to infer the topic mixture distribution and the word distribution for each topic.

::: callout-tip
One example is that the newspaper articles cover various subjects such as *politics* and *economics*. By utilizing topic modeling, we can assess the **extent to which the articles focus on each topic** and observe how these **prevalences fluctuate over time.**
:::

## Structural Topic Model (STM)

The motivation behind the STM is to provide a framework that **incorporates document-level covariate information**, which can improve the inference of topics. Unlike Latent Dirichlet Allocation, the STM allows researchers to incorporate additional information about the documents, such as *time, journal title, author* or contextual data.

::: callout-tip
This tool is relatively new, but it has gained popularity in the field of economics and finance research. You can find a recent publication from our institution is @csillag2022.

::: r-fit-text
Pros 🥰

-   Text mining is a **relatively new 🆕** research method that has gained popularity in recent years. It has a **great potential 👊🏻** to make valuable contributions to various topics in finance 💰 and economics 📈.

Cons 🤕

-   At times, it can be challenging to **find** 🔍 a sufficient amount of textual data that aligns with your research question.

-   **Cleaning** 🧹 and preprocessing tasks require **programming ⌨️ expertise** 🧐 due to the possibility of numerous emerging issues (often computationally intensive that requiring optimization) and that there is **no one-size-fits-all solution** 🤷‍♂️.
